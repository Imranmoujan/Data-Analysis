# Olympics_Dataset_cleaning_and_analysis
This project primarily focuses on data cleaning. It involves using two datasets: NOC and Athlete. I integrated a column from the NOC dataset into the Athlete dataset based on their corresponding NOC columns. The cleaning operations included handling null values, removing unnecessary phrases from columns, transforming categorical values into numerical representations, and removing unnecessary columns from the dataset.
